The Dragon Ball series has seen somewhat of a resurgence over the past few years, and Dragon Ball Legends capitalizes on that. The game is a lot of fun, especially if you’re a Dragon Ball fan, and it sees you fight through a series of different levels, collecting abilities and characters along the way. Tap and swipe to attack, move, or dodge and tap cards for special attacks and abilities; everything can be pulled off with a single finger. It’s also built to be played in portrait mode, which makes it easy to play on the road. There is also a PvP mode for real-time one on one fights with people around the world.
