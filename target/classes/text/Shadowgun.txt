If you love some shooter action, but like a little sprinkle of RPG in there, then it’s time to suit up and get ready for some alien combat. The neon-lit central hub is a hive of activity, with a bar, stores, a casino, and lots of shady characters who can give you missions. You can complete missions to loot gear, sell it to buy more gear, and build up your abilities and reputation as a tough space mercenary. The combat is frenetic, there’s a decent amount of customization on offer, and you can also take on co-op missions with other players or test your mettle in real-time PvP arenas. This is probably the best sci-fi shooter in the Play Store right now.
