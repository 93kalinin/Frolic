Can you create a working subway system for a city as it expands? This stylish, strangely soothing puzzle game seems simple at first, charging you with drawing lines between stations to keep everything connected. But random city growth soon throws up obstacles and you’ll unlock new trains, carriages, track, tunnels, and other upgrades to help you build out a great metro network. There are 20 different cities to play, each with a slightly different feel and unique challenge presented by the local river system. There are a few different modes and you can compete against other players in daily challenges which keeps you coming back. It’s a very moreish game and well worth the price.
