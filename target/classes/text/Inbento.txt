If youâ€™re looking for a puzzle game with a charming, minimal art style, tranquil soundtrack, and some genuine challenges, then inbento could be worth your $3. You play as mother cat and you need to make up a bento box to feed your kitten. You can drag pieces of food onto the box, or tap to rotate them, but you need to nail the recipe exactly and that means getting every piece in its rightful place to produce the correct pattern. Like all good puzzle games, it starts out gently and seems simplistic, but grows more and more difficult as you progress through the levels. There are lots of puzzles here to keep you busy and the price of admission ensures there are no ads to disturb your play.
