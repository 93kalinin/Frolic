If you’re looking for a space strategy game with an expansive universe this could be the one for you. In Hades’ Star, you’ll colonize planets, construct a fleet of spaceships, open trade routes, mine resources, research new technologies, and explore the farthest reaches of the galaxy. You’ll also come up against hostile alien races. The multiplayer modes allow you to work together with others to complete tricky missions, establish diplomatic relations, and even band together into Corporations, but the PvP stuff is all optional. It’s a little slow and there’s inevitably some grinding, but this is one of the best sci-fi-themed RTS games in the Play Store.
