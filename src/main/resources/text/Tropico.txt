There arenâ€™t enough in-depth strategy games in the Play Store, so the arrival of a redesigned Tropico title is worth celebrating. Cast in the role of El Presidente, you must modernize your Caribbean island and see if you can line your own pockets along the way. You decide on an approach, from ruling with an iron fist as a military dictator to creating a tourist haven beyond compare to leading your people through a glorious industrial revolution that raises living standards for all. This unique mix of building sim and political strategy is a lot of fun and has been tailored for mobile play. The $12 price of entry gets you the full game, free of ads or in-app payments, and you can play it offline.
