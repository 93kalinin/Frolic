This is the fourth entry in the creepy puzzle series The Room and it’s a game all puzzle fans should grab. The plot concerns the disappearance of a couple from Waldegrave Manor, and there’s a detailed dollhouse in the attic that serves as a challenging and intriguing puzzle box. It doesn’t matter if you haven’t played previous titles in the series, because it’s easy to get to grips with the clever touch controls as you explore intricate environments and manipulate the objects within to uncover hidden mechanisms that enable you to progress. It’s a beautiful game with a score that adds some atmosphere and a twisty plot that gradually comes into focus as you work your way through the puzzles.
